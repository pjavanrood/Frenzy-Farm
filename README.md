Frenzy Farm
=============
This project is a simple implementation of the popular video game, Frenzy Farm, a series developed by HeroCraft. In this game, you work as a farmer and manage your farm. My version has 4 different levels, where you complete certain tasks to pass the level. These tasks include creating certain products like eggs, flour, bread, fabrics, etc. In addition, each level unlocks new features, such as new animals and factories.
I quite enjoyed creating this software, because it was very challenging in terms of object-oriented concepts. I created numerous classes which inherit from each other and share some attributes and methods. 
For the GUI, I used the JavaFX library and the SceneBuilder to create XML files.
Something interesting that I enjoyed making, is a function that I called glowButton. I used this function to create an effect of glowing, when mouse is moved on some images.
Special thanks to my friend Hooman for helping me in this project.
Here are some screenhots from the game.

You can collect these products by left clicking them, and they will be stored in the storage. after collecting them, you can load them into the truck and send the truck to the market whenever you want. By sending the truck, you are selling the products and will receive coins when the truck comes back:
